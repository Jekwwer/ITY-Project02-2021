## 📋 **Project Task**

Create a document in LaTeX that mirrors the provided sample document's structure and format.

---

## 🛠 **General Guidelines**

1. 🎨 **Appearance**:

   - Focus on utilizing proper LaTeX commands rather than mimicking the exact look of the sample.
   - Prioritize correct LaTeX structures even if it means slight deviations from the sample's appearance.

2. 📝 **Document Content**:

   - The sample document contains crucial information for successful project completion—read thoroughly.

3. 📚 **Commands Usage**:

   - Most typesetting commands were covered in ITY lectures.
   - Look out for highlighted commands within the document's text.
   - Some commands might be new; finding and understanding their use is essential for LaTeX proficiency.

4. ✨ **Special Attention Points**:
   - Ensure accuracy in commands for lists, sections, and footnotes.
   - Properly typeset web addresses, emails, and ensure all links are functional and highlighted upon hovering.
   - Correct translation is key for section links to avoid "???" placeholders.
